# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Overbooking Optimization via Dynamic Programming

## üìÑ Overview

This project applies dynamic programming to optimize airline overbooking policies for coach and first-class tickets over a 365-day selling horizon. It considers pricing decisions, overbooking levels, no-sale options, and seasonal demand effects. We evaluate and simulate multiple policies to determine the most profitable and robust approach.

## üß† Problem Statements and Approaches

### üß© Problem 1: Fixed Overbooking Policy (+5 Seats)

- **Objective**: Maximize expected discounted profit when coach is oversold by 5 seats (total 105).
- **Method**: Bellman recursion with 4 pricing options; show-up modeled as binomial distribution (95% coach, 97% first-class).
- **Result**:  
  `Expected Profit: $41,886.16`

---

### üß© Problem 2: Optimal Fixed Overbooking Level

- **Objective**: Evaluate overbooking from +6 to +15 seats to find maximum profit.
- **Result**:  
  `Optimal Overbooking: +9 coach seats`  
  `Expected Profit: $42,134.62`

---

### üß© Problem 3: No-Sale Option for Coach

- **Objective**: Add option to skip selling coach tickets on a day.
- **Decision Set**: Coach: $300, $350, No Sale; First-class: $425, $500.
- **Max Coach Cap**: 120
- **Result**:  
  `Expected Profit: $42,139.89`

---

### üß© Problem 4: Seasonality in Demand

- **Objective**: Introduce seasonality by increasing sale probabilities as departure date approaches.
- **Method**: Probability multiplier = `0.75 + t / 730` where t = day index.
- **Result**:  
  `Optimal Overbooking: +16 to +20 seats`  
  `Expected Profit: $41,841.11`

---

### üß© Problem 5: Forward Simulation (10,000 Runs)

- **Objective**: Compare Policy 1 (Fixed) vs Policy 2 (Seasonal + No Sale) under stochastic demand.
- **Findings**:
  - Policy 1: higher profit, lower volatility, lower overbooking cost.
  - Policy 2: performs better under stressed conditions (higher coach attendance rate).
- **Recommendation**:  
  Use **Policy 1** under normal demand  
  Use **Policy 2** under high-attendance stress
